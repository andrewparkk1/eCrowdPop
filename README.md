# eCrowdPop

A startup crowd-surveying platform.

Problem: non-entrepreneurial people have problems that they want fixed -> entrepreneurs should realize these problems and create solutions

Competitors: CrowdPop (downside: doesn't use iterative algorithm, layout is not user-friendly, doesn't emphasis user-creator interactions)

Goals: Share startup ideas, communicate between business/consumers, find which startup ideas consumers would use.
